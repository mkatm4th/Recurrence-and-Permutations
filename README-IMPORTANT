This is a repository of some of the animations I developed for my SoME4 entry —— Made using the ManimCE v0.19.0 Library.

Initially, this project began as just a few visual demonstrations of some combinatorics results I was working on for a class I planned to start teaching at the beginning of 2025.
In the end, however, the class didn’t quite work out, so I had to shelve all the work I’d already done —— mostly on Kaplansky’s lemmas and some of the intricacies within recurrences.
Honestly, at the time it felt pretty disappointing —— besides being the first time I’d picked up Python in a long while, it was also my first experience using Manim,
so I had invested a lot of time and effort into learning the library and producing the animations.

At first, though I already had some thoughts about submitting an entry to SoME 2025, I never planned to use this previous work for it. Later, however, I figured since I already had something half-finished
(which, as I’d sadly come to realize later, wasn’t even 1/20 done), I might as well build upon it.
Using some of the notes I’d written for that class, along with a few problem sets I’d devised, I selected a few interesting topics in combinatorics I had worked with before
and assembled the initial list of subjects you can still see in the scripts.

Looking at the final version, though, you’ll notice not all of them made it into the video —— and this whole thing is to basically say why.

As you can probably tell, I’m not very familiar with Python and still a pretty amateur coder overall. In truth, most of my previous projects had been either very short
or completed over long periods of time, so I had no idea how massive a task I was taking on for just the 2 month period SoME provided for submissions, especially while juggling high school alongside it.

I spent a lot of time trying to design appealing visuals for my questions (some eye candy)
and elaborate animations to develop each problem, all while still trying to cover a huge amount of content.
This in turn, however, left me with very little time for post-production. By the final week before the submission deadline, 
I’d only finished about 80% of the animations —— still needing to finalize the narration script and edit the video.

That’s when I had to make the tough executive decision to cut out some of the work I’d done. I chose to keep the part on recurrences (since most of that script was already complete from earlier work)
and the part on the reflection principle, since the explanations there were fairly short.
For curiosity’s sake, the original version was nearly 50 minutes of animations alone —— probably around an hour and a half after editing —— so definitely long for an amateur YouTube video on math.

Overall, even if it didn’t turn out all bad, I don’t think it reflects my best work. Because of time constraints,
I had to set aside a lot of my usual scrutiny and make compromises I really didn’t want to —— sometimes drifting from the original intent of making an engaging experience behind the project.
Unfortunately, the limited post-production time really affected the final video quality. But, not all in the negative, it also taught me a valuable lesson for future projects.
Anyway, if you’re reading this —— thank you for checking out my video! I hope that, despite its flaws, you still ended up learning something new.
